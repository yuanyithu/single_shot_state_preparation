# exp102 status

**PILOT LADDER EXHAUSTED AT R128 / BLOCKED — production not started**

The independent registry, bit-identical reference/Numba hard-coset q=0 PT, net-transport
diagnostics, task identity/resume, fail-closed aggregation, publication loader, and pilot cell
runner are implemented. The first fake-Numba `R=8` ladder completed but failed all 576 cells; its
partial `R=12` successor was stopped after the full-round Numba replacement made that source SHA
obsolete. That history is audit-only; the clean-SHA ladder search described below supersedes it.
Held-out certification and the 6144 production tasks have not run, so no threshold curve or
scientific result is claimed.

Production requires `engine=numba`; the reference engine is an oracle only. The full-round Numba
kernel is bit-identical through the `k=64` boundary and gives about 177x--196x speedup in local
benchmarks. The R96/R128 extension source passes 52 exp102 tests and all 365 exp101 regressions;
the prior clean source also passed cross-node preflight before its ladder search.

The clean full-round source `bbe72da` passed three-node preflight and produced 10,752/10,752
ordered ladder cells. A post-run audit found that ladder/gamma had incorrectly inherited the
rounds-stage character-trace gate. This is now fixed, but the raw counters independently confirm
that m=4..8 still fail the actual ladder requirement at the maximum `(p_hot=0.49,R=64)` candidate:
only `93/96,89/96,85/96,84/96,87/96` cells pass swap/hot/residual. Under the frozen policy, those m
values must stop rather than proceed to gamma/rounds/held-out. No `FROZEN_HELD_OUT_PASS` exists.
Resuming requires an explicitly reviewed pilot-contract change, such as expanding R or changing
the ladder family, followed by a clean-SHA pilot rerun.

On 2026-07-20 the user approved appending `(p_hot=0.49,R=96)` and then `R=128` after the original
21 ladder pairs. Clean source `2b01d9dcb463ec47a1b30202fc9105430b95e18c` passed three-node
preflight; all nodes produced Linux smoke digest
`b9a5c8b22d8b2421723705b1567b825a5a1775a8efd20748e884436f8bee959f`. Run
`exp102_pilot_20260720_2b01d9d` completed all 13,056 planned ladder cells through the conditional
R128 attempt, with hashes verified locally against 13,270 remote files. Fresh merge-select chose
m=3 at `(0.45,64)` and m=4 at `(0.49,96)`, but the maximum R128 candidate left m=5..8 at
`94/96,94/96,93/96,94/96`; every failure was the `p=0.04` minimum swap-rate gate. Those sizes are
therefore `EXHAUSTED` under the frozen 23-pair policy. Gamma, rounds, held-out, freezer, task plan,
and production were not started. Resuming requires an explicitly reviewed new pilot/config
contract; lowering gates, hand-writing a freezer, or launching a reduced production is forbidden.
